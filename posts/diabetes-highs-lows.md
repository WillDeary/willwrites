Let me firstly talk about what diabetes is and answer some common questions I have received when people find out I am diabetic.
There are technically two categories. Type 1 & Type 2.

# Clearing things up

#### Type 2
This is by far the most common type with 90% of diabetic adults being T2.
Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body is not making enough insulin, or the insulin it is making is not being used properly.  
``` Insulin is a hormone that controls blood glucose.  ```  
The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes can be reduced by changes in lifestyle.
It is not as simple to say that people with T2 diabetes are just overweight.  
Whilst being overweight is one of the major contributing factors to developing T2 diabetes, you can develop T2 without being overweight.  
Whilst there is no cure, losing weight, healthy eating and exercise can help manage this disease.
If these don't help then you can take diabetic medication or inject insulin.


#### Type 1

Here the body produces no insulin.
This is caused by an autoimmune response against the pancreatic beta cells.
Effectively the body is attacking its own pancreas rendering it somewhat useless!
Of children with diabetes aged under 17, 97% are type 1.

The cause of T1 diabetes is unknown, but it can be passed on from your parents. The risk of development are roughly:
```
- Diabetic Mother = ~2%
- Diabetic Father = ~8%
- Both Parents = ~30%  
(Taken from diabetes.org.uk)    
```

What are some of the symptoms?
```
- More thirsty than normal
- Frequent toilet visits (pee, not poop), higher during the night
- Tiredness
- Weight loss
- Blurred vision
- Cuts and grazes not healing  
```
There are several ways to test for it.  The doctor can do a very simple blood glucose (BG) test, by testing a drop of your blood.
For non-diabetics this should be between 4-7. The doctor can also do a urine test and a normal blood test.   
When my Mother first suspected I might be diabetic my BG was 13. Nearly double what it should have been.
She guessed something might be wrong with me after I was finishing school, going straight for a nap and then after waking up,
I would go off to training, get home, eat dinner and fall straight asleep again.
She also noticed I was drinking a lot more than normal.

I was super lucky that we caught my diabetes when we did. I was 16 soon turning 17, which is quite late to develop diabetes.
I remember when I found out. I had just finished my work experience at RAF Coningsby.
I was 100% sure after those 5 days learning all about the RAF that I wanted to join and become a fighter pilot.  
Work experience finished it was time for a holiday. I went to the Isles of Scilly for a week.
Just before going, with some of the previously mentioned symptoms my Mother had taken me to the doctor and I had some blood tests done.

I went on holiday and forgot all about going to the hospital and just enjoyed myself on holiday, eating drinking and generally being lazy.
A few days in I received a phone call from my Mum telling me to just be careful what I was eating, and to not eat too much sugary food.
I just assumed she didn't want me getting fat whilst on holiday.  
Unknown to me, my Mum had actually received a call from the hospital telling her that I was in the very early stages of diabetes.
So she did the thing any mother would do, and let me enjoy and finish my holiday before breaking the news to me.  
This was some pretty tough news to face at the time. The RAF vocation was out - no diabetics allowed in the military.

At least I still had my fencing, which 8 months prior I was on top of the world with.
I had won one of the U17 international competitions and was doing great.
Shortly after that I think is when the first symptoms started, and with that my results dropped.
I wasn't going to let this destroy another dream of mine, so I refused to stop fencing.
There was a lot of adjustment to get used to. Gone are the days of turning up to training and fencing non-stop until training was over.
Now the curve ball of managing blood sugar on top of all the normal stresses of school, training and competitions.

#### So how did I do it?
To put it bluntly, I didn't have any choice but to get on with it.  
To begin I was in what is known as the honeymoon period (there was no love going on here!).   
To sum up the honeymoon period; the pancreas is still producing some insulin.
Just not enough to quite get the job done. So now you just have to increase the amount of insulin you have each week
to account for the cruel fate your body has decided for your pancreas.

You give yourself insulin by injecting yourself. No not in the veins like heroin addicts.
But into your fat.  
To begin the doctors give you two insulin pens. Fast acting (short term) and slow acting (long term) insulin.
The short term insulin you inject with all of your meals (known as a bolus in the medical world).
The long term insulin you inject once a day and it lasts for 24 hours, effectively managing your blood sugar for all the times in-between meals
(this is known as your basal rate).

Giving yourself too much of either of the types of insulin causes hypoglycaemia.
This is where there is not enough glucose in your blood. Sometimes symptoms of hypoglycaemia start as feeling hungry,
then so hungry like you haven't eaten for several days. You sweat profusely, shake uncontrollably,
turn pale and my favourite; easily irritated (I finally have an excuse!).

If these early symptoms aren't fixed quickly you may pass out, feel very week or have blurred vision.
Luckily its very easily treated by giving yourself something high in sugar. My go-to is glucose tablets.
(Pop 4-6 of them, have a bar of something, wait a while and then I'm good to go.).

> Insulin lowers blood glucose. So if you see a passed out diabetic, chances are they need sugar and not insulin! It is a huge misconception that we need our insulin when we are unconscious. This is like trying to save a drowning man by pouring more water over his head.

Give yourself too little of these insulins and you have what is known as hyperglycaemia. A Fancy word for too much sugar in your blood.  
Now the scary thing about these is you don't notice them as much as hypos. You might notice you have high blood sugar by going to
wee more often and becoming thirsty, becoming tired and blurred vision. Now you might think,
well these symptoms don't sound as bad as when your blood sugar is low. Well for the most part you are correct.
Apart from when we take into account the long term affects of high blood sugar.

Having high blood sugar can cause something known as diabetic ketoacidosis.  
Here you body has released a harmful substance called ketones.
Ketones are an acid remaining from when the body burns its own fat.
Many people will have a low level of this if they are losing weight.

However when the body has insufficient insulin it cannot get the glucose from the blood which it needs for cells within the body.
So, it turns to the body fat as its energy source.  Your liver converts fatty acids into ketones which are then released
into the blood for energy use. Too many of these ketones can put you into a diabetic coma, which is very hard to get out of.

Obviously this is one extreme, but another reason for not wanting high blood sugar is diabetic neuropathy,
where the nerves in the body get damaged. This is why you hear of diabetics needing amputation.

These are just some of the things to try not to worry about when first diagnosed with diabetes...

#### So back on track.

During this honeymoon period you are trying to guess (with the doctorâ€™s help) the correct dosages of both the types of insulin.
This is complicated enough without training 5x a week. It is however not impossible! If I managed it, anyone can.

I got through it by preparing what I called my diabetes bag, it never left me, I always knew where it was and what was in it!

#### What was in it?

- Lots and lots of glucose - to manage the many hypos (low blood sugar) I would have due to giving too much insulin with meals or too much of the long term insulin. Or not eating enough that day etc etc.
- My insulin pens & needles
- My BG meter. Used to test my blood glucose
- More food, normally in the form of some kind of bar. (Now I use Nature Valley bars - Not sponsored)

I'll tell you what, having this bag on me has definitely saved me, sometimes hypos hit at the worst possible opportunity.  
You could just be out for a walk and suddenly start to feel all shaky and weak, and probably without a bag full of all these
goodies I would have passed out.  
Other things to get used to during this time was having to inject myself, something that really made me feel self-conscious.  
There was a lot to get used to. Mainly because I was at school and didn't really want people to see me injecting myself,
so I would eat lunch and go to the bathroom to inject up.  
This really makes you feel like a shady drug addict, sneaking off to go get my drugs during school hours! (how rebellious).  
Not really. In reality it was much more of me going into the bathroom with my diabetes bag,
getting everything out and injecting myself while sat on the loo (very glamourous).
