### Getting my Insulin Pump
So several months maybe a year has gone by, your honeymoon period is over ( I still don't love diabetes)
and hopefully you have your blood glucose (BG) somewhat under control.
At this point they told me, Will you're doing great, and because of the amount of sport you do we have
fast tracked you to get an insulin pump! Which will give you an even finer control over your diabetes and
allow you to micromanage your insulin even more... Great. Time to experiment with insulin amounts all over again.

The reason for all this experimentation is because unlike with insulin pens where there are 2 types
of insulin you take, with a pump you only have the short term (fast acting) insulin. So, you have to drip
feed this insulin into your body at different rates through the day. Everyone has different basal rates
(background insulin levels), which change based on your bodies circadian rhythm and how much exercise you do.  
In short there is no magical formula for how it works. So, they tell you to do some fasting tests to see what
happens to your basal over the course of 24hrs. I hate these as it means I must go a long time without eating.
Luckily, these tests are made a lot easier with the use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). These give you a
graph of what has happened to your blood glucose over the last few hours. So, using all this information we can
create our basal patterns. My basal and glucose patterns look like this:

Now these can change wildly depending on how much exercise you do.
Luckily for me I keep a pretty constant level of exercise so I can keep my basal pattern the same.
But if I decide to take 2 weeks holiday, I might have to up my basal 20% whilst I am on holiday to account
for the lack of exercise. You can also see that I have two spikes in the day, one around 15:00 and one around 20:00.
These correspond to meals. These spikes are natural in everyone. However, they are somewhat more
extreme in diabetics.   
Firstly, this is because non-diabetics insulin is secreted directly into the blood stream,
so it acts faster, and non-diabetics produce a hormone called Amylin, which keeps food from reaching the
intestines quickly. So, diabetics digest food quicker than normal and the insulin doesn't work as fast.
Both contribute to these spikes in BG.  A work around I am trying for this is to take the insulin 15-20 minutes
earlier than normal. However, in practise it is quite hard to judge how much food you're going to eat before you've
eaten it.

### Carb counting & carb ratios
So, you're thinking well you're diabetic that must mean you need to be very careful what you eat.  
Well no, not really.  
Blood Glucose is affected by the amount of carbohydrate you eat. Sugar is a form of carbohydrate.  
So, while many people think diabetics need to just cut out sugar, they're wrong. Now you need to
know how much insulin to give based on how many carbohydrates you eat. This is known as your carb ratio.
Again, everyone's carb ratio is different, so experimentation is needed to find it out.

Now we get onto the fun of "calculating" (guessing) how many carbohydrates there are in foods.
This is easy for packaged food; on loaves of bread it tells you there is 16.8g of carbs per slice.
This is easy, I tell my pump I had 2 slices of bread ~34g of carbohydrate by inputting 34g of carbohydrate.
The pump then calculates the amount of insulin I now need. Pretty easy!  Well it is if you know the carbs.

Let's say I'm out and about and decide I fancy food. I go into a restaurant and order what I want.
Firstly, I can't give my insulin 20 minutes early. What if the kitchen has a problem,
or the portion is much smaller than I expected? Then the food arrives, now I must use my highly
trained and carb counting genius brain to calculate how much carbohydrate is on the plate in front of me.  
Effectively we must just make educated guesses based on previous food we have eaten,
relying on previous carb knowledge of that food.

There are apps that help with this process. Carbs & Cals is the one I used most when I was first diagnosed. You type in what you're eating,
and it shows you various pictures of that food and how many carbs it could be. Again,
it's all down to experimenting, sometimes you get it right and your BG is good.
Sometimes wrong and you either gave too much insulin and now have low BG or too little insulin and now have high BG.
What a fun little game we play before every meal!

Its not as bad as it sounds.  You get used to having to do these things really quickly and it
soon becomes second nature.  There is lots of help given to me from my various support network of doctors around me,
for which I am eternally grateful.

In a future blog I will talk further about managing my diabetes with my intense training, competitions and travel, which adds another level of complexity.
But where would the fun be without the challenge.
