Welcome to my first blog post. It is great to have you here. I decided to create these blogs
as a way for me to express my views and share my experiences. This first blog is just about who I am.

## Who am I?

I am a British fencer who competes for GBR at senior international events, at the time of
writing I am the British national sabre champion and GBR ranked number 1 fencer with my hopes
set on the now postponed 2020 (2021) Olympic games.

**What else about me?**

I am a computer science student from Kings College London. I always had a passion for playing computer games as
a child, in fact my mother tells me the only reason I learnt to read as a child was because I wanted to play Monkey
Island (probably not a game for a young child but oh well...).

When I turned 18 I had the opportunity to move to London to pursue my fencing training with the British national team
being funded via UKSport. So I delayed going to university and jumped upon this chance to train full-time.  
This was a brilliant time for me, moving to London, training "full-time" and almost
living by myself. I say almost because I was very fortunate for a lovely woman to let me stay in her house
while I was training, though she was extremely busy so for the most part I was by myself.

So this dream of being a full-time athlete... Let me tell you, it gets real boring. We trained 5 days a week
and most of the time it was 9am-3pm. This gave me most of the afternoon and the evening free. At 18 what
excitement this was, 7 hours free to play computer games! Great! Well, no, after a few months of playing computer
games non-stop, it gets a little dull. So that was how I ended up teaching myself how to program. I think this
bewildered my Father as he had been trying to teach me how to program for years, and I had no interest in it.. Oops.  
So here I was learning how to make very very basic computer games and websites. So, I thought why don't I do this
for my degree. (I had originally applied for aeronautical engineering. :sleeping:).  
That's how I became a programmer. I finished my first two years of uni, and now have nearly finished my year
hiatus, which was to train for the Olympics. Now that the Corona virus has got in the way I will have to have another
year off. What a shame...

Now I live and train in Germany, until the Olympic cycle is over. This was supposed to be in April, however Corona
struck a few weeks before the last Olympic qualifying event, and now the whole qualifying period has been put
on hold for a year. So when the virus settles down I'll be back in Germany training with the guys there. This experience
has been brilliant. Firstly, living in another country not being able to speak the language was something I never
thought I would experience. Secondly, I have learnt a lot by training with the Germans, and it has shown me
the importance of having a close knit team environment and how that can lead to success. The German team I
train with has already qualified for the Olympics.

With my now several years of programming experience, my old fencing coach pitched an idea to me on how we could
improve physical education and use health & wellbeing to monitor children at schools. That was how we created
[Record Of Fitness](https://www.recordoffitness.com).  
Then during the lockdown we stripped down Record Of Fitness (ROF) and created a lite version for everyone to use
in lockdown. [BBFit](https://www.recordoffitness.com/bbfit).  
Creating these two apps taught me a tremendous amount on how web applications work, and creating a good work
environment, without getting too distracted with life and the many things it throws at you.
I am a strong believer of use what time you have wisely, and really, this lockdown is the perfect time for
me to finish as much of Record Of Fitness as I can.

Lastly, and to me most unimportant, I am a diabetic. Now you might ask, now why has he only just mentioned this! Or
perhaps why is he mentioning it if it's unimportant. Well the truth of it is, I just don't care that I'm
diabetic. I found out when I was 16 years old, which is quite late for a T1 diabetic. I will always remember finding out
and my Mother being more upset about it than I was, somehow she was blaming herself. Anyway, with my dream of becoming a
fighter pilot in the gutter (no diabetics are allowed in any of the armed forces), I refused to let diabetes ruin my
chances at becoming a good athlete. I was always a hard worker, so now, I would just have to work even harder and not
let diabetes take over my life.  
An annoying but surprisingly useful quote:
> Control the controllables.

And that was what I had to do. and I'll tell you what, it isn't easy living as a diabetic and watching what you have to
eat, carb counting everything you eat, dealing with high blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) and low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia),
along with the various mood swings and general inconvenience. But I guess at this point it has made me who I am today.
And that I would never want to change. (But if somebody could cure diabetes, please hurry up.)
