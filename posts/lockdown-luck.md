Here I want to take a look at some of the positive spins of the Corona Virus lockdown,
the good things that have come out of it and to thank all the key workers.

Lockdown has had a terrible impact on all of us, with loved ones dying, the economy crashing and the
world going into a panic. A massive thank you needs to go out to all of the key workers at this time.  
All the NHS staff who are at risk everyday helping those who need it. The delivery drivers,
postmen and postwomen who have helped make lockdown more bearable. And to everyone of you who has helped
people out during this lockdown.  
Thank you all.

## What have I done?

After the bedlam and panic of Corona subsided and I had rushed back to my parents home from Germany;
I didn't want to be stuck there with no training and not understanding any of the language.
I had to think of how to best make use of my time.

Firstly I am very lucky to be able to stay in my parents house which is big enough so we are not
always on top of each other. Secondly I was graced with the fortune of borrowing some gym equipment
from my fencing club, a day before lockdown was officially announced.  
Now, with space available and some gym equipment I could at least maintain some level of fitness,
however, this would only fill 1-2 hours of my day. I had to think of some other ways to fill my time.
I am not one to waste an opportunity when it is available.




Lockdown has been the perfect chance for all of us to take time to reflect on our busy schedules and
dedicate time to things that we normally would neglect. Those people who now will work from home and who no
longer have to travel to and from work have saved many hours a day just by not travelling. A 45 minute journey
to & from work is no longer needed, parents no longer have to drop their children off at school and pick them up
again. These factors will all lead to increased productivity due to more free time, and less time spent
doing banal tasks. Now this productivity does not need to be spent on more working hours, many of us just
need the welcome break that Corona has given us. We can spend this time relaxing and furthering our interests.

Personally I have achieved loads during lockdown. 2 years ago I started work on a web app for
revolutionising the way physical education is viewed around the country.
Like any project the motivation has soared and crashed over the 2 years,
but lockdown has given me the perfect oppurtunity to really get my teeth sunk into this project.
It gave me the chance to release a minimal "home" version of our main app [BBFit](https://www.recordoffitness.com/bbfit/)
and go through the pains of software development and release without the everyday stresses of normal life.  
I also started this blog, for a long time I have wanted a way of expressing my views and sharing the stories
I have had whilst travelling the globe for fencing. When I discovered GitHub pages and saw how it could be
designed and used in the way I wanted, I thought now was the chance for me to finally express myself and
learn this new way of releasing a personal website.

As a "programmer" it is always important to try and stay current with the trends and always learn new
programming languages. Lockdown was another perfect chance for this.
This mindset does not only apply to programmers but all of us, we now have the time to get ourselves up
to date with current trends and really explore avenues that without this time off we wouldn't be able to do.

Lockdown for me has also brought our family closer together. I have a large family with my parents,
3 brothers, two sisters, 6 nieces and a nephew. Before lockdown we maybe all got together a handful of times a year.
While we still can't physically be together, we have started a weekly family group call where we typically all do
a quiz together. It's a great way for us to all stay in contact with each other and it gives the week some structure.
I know that every Sunday we will all sit down for a chat and a quiz.

Cooking was always a passion of mine too, but normally I would never bother to spend more than an hour
cooking for myself. Since being stuck inside I have cooked several meals I wouldn't have bothered to make.
My personal favourite was bao buns with slow cooked pork. Where the pork was cooked for 8 hours the day before
and the buns made in the morning before being steamed just before dinner. It was incredible.

I did some tasks to help around the house, I helped my parents dig out and fill with gravel some steps around the garden. As a fit youth this was a lot easier for me to do than it was for them. So I was happy to help.

We also try to do small things for each other. My Father has really missed going to the pub, he has been doing it for the last 50 years so I don't blame him! My Mother and I decided we would convince him to go for a walk on the beach (which he hates, normally he does it with his eyes set on the pub after). What my Father didn't know was we actually had packed him a few beers and a bottle of wine which we all enjoyed together on the beach. Little things like this have really made the difference for us in lockdown.

Overall, yes lockdown has been a very boring and stressful time for the most of us. However now we are past the initial shock of being trapped in our own homes, we can make the most of our time. Learn new skills, finally read that book we have always wanted to read but never found the time to read, stay connected with our family and friends and let them know we support them in these times. And most importantly, take some time to finally relax and appreciate the things we had before the lockdown started.

Lockdown has been a huge inconvenience, but maybe in the long term, it will benefit us all, revolutionise how we are treaded in the workplace. Maybe we no longer need to travel into work 5x a week or travel to the other side of the world for a meeting that could just as easily be done online.
Lastly, we can now consider the environmental factors of lockdown, nitrogen dioxide levels are up to 40% lower than the same period last year. Motorway traffic has been down 83% which has vastly reduced carbon emissions. Everywhere is feeling this positive effect, from the waters in Venice becoming clear, many cities skylines becoming visible again with the reduction of smog, and in Europe there were 6000 less asthma cases in children. Yes when lockdown is eased people will jump straight back into their cars and pollutants will rise again. But hopefully this lockdown can help educate us all on the positive effects of reducing our emissions.
