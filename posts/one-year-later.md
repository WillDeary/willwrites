It's been a long time since my last blog. A lot has happened in the last year. After corona "slowed down" in England around August I decided to move back to Germany. It had been 6 months of no fencing and pretty much just running and using the home gym. Actually I felt great, it was the first time in maybe 13 years I had had such a long time off from fencing. Obviously it was strange to return to fencing, but I was fortunate that I could return to Germany and train with the national team again.

So I moved into a new flat, this time a little longer than the 5 minute walk I had before but a 15 minute drive still isn't so long to get to training. Things were a little different here, getting used to wearing a mask everywhere and still not really knowing any German meant I was just praying that in the supermarkets I was following all of the German Corona rules and I wouldn't get stopped and fined for doing something stupid. The only tiny bit of trouble I had was not getting a shopping trolley and I made it all the way to the checkout with no problems, and then after putting all of my groceries on the conveyor belt the cashier told me "german german du german Wagen german german german." and then wouldn't serve me until I went outside and got my Wagen! (German for shopping cart). That was the last time I went to Aldi without a shopping cart!

Training was then really good and I was feeling confident and refreshed. I was enjoying living here and doing lots of fitness, lessons and fencing training. During this time I also started talking to a nutritionist which helped me just clean up what I was eating without drastically changing anything. His advice was actually so simple but effective. I had the goal of wanting to lose some weight. I was around 93kg when I arrived in Germany, which was about my "normal" weight for the last few years, but I decided I could do with losing some and seeing how I felt after I lost some, after all, for me it's a lot easier to put weight on, so if it wasn't useful I could just eat more again. Win. Win.
The advice was just to focus on both portion size and lower fat foods.
For breakfast I mostly just eat yoghurt with berries and some granola. The easy change here was just watch what yoghurt I was buying, and try and reduce it. Now I just have 1.5% fat yoghurt each morning.
Lunch & dinner, honestly I didn't change too much. I just padded my meals with more vegetables to fill me up more, which stopped me wanting to eat junk food through out the day.
Lastly, with the portion sizes, I just cooked what I would anyway. Like some filled pasta with pesto. Then I would portion out what I think would be enough, normally half of what I cooked, and stick the other half away, which I would then normally eat for lunch the next day.
In the end it was all pretty easy and at the time of writing this I am down to 85kg. An 8kg loss in around 6 months seemed pretty good to me. With these small changes in diet I found my blood sugar was also much better, less junk food and more consistent meals meant less sugar spikes and lower glucose levels overall.

### German Christmas

4 more months of me being in Germany passed and with the Corona situation becoming much worse again, I realised going home for Christmas and then trying to come back to Germany would be pretty difficult. The decision was made to just stay put in Germany and see all my family after Corona settled down (whenever that would be).  
Luckily for me I had started dating a wonderful German girl who's family very generously/stupidly let me stay with them for Christmas. I have been very lucky to have been able to stay with them and learn how Germans do Christmas!

Firstly! And most crazy, Christmas day is on the 24th December, this idea took me a while to get my head around. Let me explain how it worked. On their Christmas day (Christmas eve) we had a big breakfast with most of the family, and started drinking some sparkling wine. Then we dressed up all fancy. I wore a suit! Around 3pm some more of the family arrived and we had some coffee and German cake together and just relaxed and chatted until the moment I had been waiting for. No not the presents. The food!
Turkey was still on the menu when my girlfriends Mum knew I was staying she ordered a 2kg heavier turkey.
I was happy that was at least the same as in England. And, there was still brussel sprouts. That was about as similar as it comes though. We had mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes, a sweet curry like sauce that is impossible to describe how it tasted. But wow it was so delicious! Also the turkey isn't carved like I had been used to the last 23 years of my life. Instead the whole turkey was placed on the table, and you just grab what you want! I had a whole turkey leg. It was heaven.

And to end the night we all opened our presents together. Now I am sure every family does this differently. At home we would just go around in a circle and open the presents one at a time. It was similar in Germany, but with one major twist. We had to roll die and only if it landed on a 6 could you open one present. Needless to say it took a few hours for 7 of us to roll enough 6's to open everything. It felt like a real reward rolling a 6 and getting to open something and was a real fun twist on what I was used to. Also luckily, in the time when everyone is taking turns rolling their die, we had a steady supply of drinks to keep us going through the night.

It was a wonderful day and I am really grateful and thankful to Kristin's family for welcoming me and letting me stay with them.

When the real Christmas day rolled around, I rang my parents, wished them a very happy Christmas and explained to them how different it was having Christmas somewhere else without them.
My Mum was very happy to hear I had been enjoying my Christmas here and was probably very grateful that she didn't have to pay to feed me on Christmas for once.
